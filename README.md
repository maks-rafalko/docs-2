# Syntax

The language is defined by a syntax that is based on the grammar of popular static code analysis tools: [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) and [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/).

More information about parsing capabilities can be found on the corresponding documentation pages for the tools.

* PHPStan: [https://phpstan.org/writing-php-code/phpdoc-types](https://phpstan.org/writing-php-code/phpdoc-types)
* Psalm: [https://psalm.dev/docs/annotating\_code/type\_syntax/atomic\_types/](https://psalm.dev/docs/annotating\_code/type\_syntax/atomic\_types/)
* phpDocumentor: [https://docs.phpdoc.org/guide/guides/types.html](https://docs.phpdoc.org/guide/guides/types.html)

Below, as an example, tables of type compatibility between **phptl**, **psalm** and **phpstan** will be drawn.
